Generate unit tests for AuthenticationService using xUnit and Moq.

Ask me:
1. Which methods to test?
2. Should I include negative test cases (e.g., invalid user id)?
3. Any specific scenarios or edge cases to consider?
Once I answer, generate:
- Tests/AuthenticationServiceTests.cs
Include Arrange-Act-Assert structure, mock DbContext or repository.
